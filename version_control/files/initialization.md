## Initialization

The very first thing that compose the **Git** workflow is the *initialization*. In simple terms, adding the version control system to the file that will contain the project. The VCS will be able to keep track of anything happening.

```bash
$ pwd
$ cd path/to/project_folder
$ git init
```
