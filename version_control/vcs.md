## Version Control System (VCS)

<br>

A *VCS* is a tool that helps developers manage changes to code over time. It allows multiple people to collaborate on a project, track modifications, and revert to previous versions if needed. Version control is essential for software development, as it ensures code integrity and enables teamwork.

The one I use is **Git**, for its wide adoption.
